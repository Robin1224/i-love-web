# The Rise of AI

## Speech recognition API
Speed recognition is built into the browser and has been supported for 7 years or so. This means it's simple to use and relatively well supported.

## Speech synthesis API
The browser also has built-in speech synthesis, meaning you can generate text-to-speech very easily.

This speech synthesis usually sounds quite robotic, though AI can be leveraged to create higher quality speech instead (using ElevenLabs for example).

## Performance over anything
No matter how cool your website is, if it's not performant, the user will just get frustrated, overpowering any positive experience they might have.

## AI is just another data source
It's the UX that makes the difference; it's about making the UX fast, giving feedback, and making it look good.

It's also important to never forget about older techniques. Oftentimes it takes many years for browser functionalities to become useful, and there might be old techniques that flew under the radar but could be useful now (like speech recognition and synthesis)
