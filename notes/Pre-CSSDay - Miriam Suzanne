# Tech continues to be political
> Being "in tech" in 2025 is depressing, and if i'm going to stick around, I need to remember why I'm here

The web has always been political; the first browser only used to work on one type of computer, no others.

The second however, although being much simpler, is usable by all. This idea, of usability for all, becomes the mission statement for the WWW project.

This means that, if we want HTML to be usable by all platforms, it should have NO device specific markup, and no control over font or colour. Basically, web design was never meant to exist.

However, we are in control. That is the problem. We can change everything we want. In print for example, we can choose exactly how something looks, and it's going to always look that way. However, on the web, things need to be contextual. We need to take into account people's devices, their viewport, their preferences, etc. And the browser is explicitly allowed to ignore our code! This is literally part of the specifications.

We're basically collaborating with our users on our design. In the early we especially, all styles were universal. All websites look the same for you; the style of a website is dependent on the user and their preferences, not on the sites themselves.

To understand CSS... set your preferences! It's okay to see "something different" from what everyone else is seeing, that's the whole point! Your design should work even when someone has preferences set, because that is how you make a robust website, that's the web we live in! So having preferences set can actually help you when developing good designs.

Once images came out, we realised we had to give web authors some control over stylistic influences, because otherwise the web would just become a bunch of pictures of text! Therefore, stylesheets were created. CSS is, in effect, "hints and suggestions", because the browser is allowed to ignore any one of them.

However, we quickly ran into conflicts; what if the browser sets a property that is also set by the website? We need exactly one value per element. That's when the cascade came along.

The cascade is weird though, as the author overwrites all styling in the cascade. This is wrong however, because the user should have the last say! That's why we got !important; to make sure the user could have the last say.

So yeah, browsers actually use !important a lot in the user agent stylesheets!

That's the purpose of !important! It's not for deveopers to get tied up and frustrated with, it's actually there for users to protect styles from future styles that might overwrite them.

### The politics
A lot of the web is dominated by a certain vision of what it should be, which often is 'growth'. Everything needs to scale. Everything is a business. Everything needs to be made money off of. The web started out as a collaborative idea, where we would share information with everyone, and where everything was open sourced.

> Book: Be open to the ideology of user-friendly

### What is friendly to a user?
Bootstrapping vs plug-and-play

> Mother of all demos - Douglas Egelbart? (movie i think?)

A lot of modern computing was first demonstrated in this demo

He had a strong vision for bootstrapping; we build tools for experts who build tools for their field, all working together, augmenting human intellect. Providing the means for users to create better tools.

> "Any barrier that exists between the user and some part of the system will eventually be a barrier to creative expression"

Interfaces should be open, adaptable.

The idea that design should be "intuitive" or "easy" is not some gospel! It's someone's vision. You should ask yourself the questions "Easy for who?" and "to do what?".

> Book: Technically Wrong - Sara Wachter-Boettcher

Design doesn't always have to be easiest! Sometimes shipping barriers is a good thing. Something it's good to make your users _think_ before they can do something.

There's politics in tools that are built around a definition of normality. Things like AI often sand away abnormalities and can only imagine the 'normal', 'perfect' person.

Websites like facebook for example change all inputs to simple selects, because they are under increasing pressure to monetize the data they store. They want to minimise difference. This is a political influence too.

### What can we do
The easiest fix is often to just give people more agency instead of doing things for them.

For example, twitter had a cropping AI which turned out to prioritise white faces over people of colour. The fix to this isn't to make another AI- it's to just let the users set cropping boundaries themselves!

> "You cannot create results; you can only create the conditions in which something might happen"

We cannot control the output, but we can create the conditions in the input in which something might happen.

When you think about design, don't always think about what's easy for the user. Think about what gives them _agency_. The goal in a lot of design feels like they're trying to find the average and design perfectly for that, but we should design for a range of people and embrace the differences.

Design for stress cases; how is this going to work when someone does have trouble with it? How does my design adapt to a situation which breaks my vision?

Think of a car seat; we don't calculate the average size of a person and put the seat there, we give the user a lever to adjust the seat!
