# Reckoning: Frontend's Lost Decade

## Platforms are competitions
You're winning or you're losing, and the web today is losing. 75% of the devices that run browsers are smartphones, and on smartphones people don't use the web as often as they do on desktop to fulfill tasks.

Most tasks on mobile phones are done on apps rather than browsers, which are often a lot worse in terms of transparency and privacy, as they are often proprietary ecosystems.


## Reasons why browsers are losing on mobile
### In-App browsers

Often break capabilities and destroy value of both users and businesses on the web because of things like unsynchronised cookie state all to get more value for the app creator.

### Search shenanigans

Things like "AI" "summaries" pushing links further down the page

### Apple's anti PWA agenda

### Missing APIs on mobile
- Apple slow-rolling everything
    - e.g., scroll-linked view transitions

### Slow CPU & network progress
