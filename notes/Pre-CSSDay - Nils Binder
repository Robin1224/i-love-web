# Wrappers
Wrappers are usually just used to create some max width for content, and add some padding, mostly for wider screens.

### But why are we doing this?
Imagine you'd have a landscape size poster, and it's just the flyer with whitespace on either side. That's dumb. We shouldn't be designing websites like this.

The reason we do this, is because of rules, like certain amounts of words per line.

Figma gave us more freedom in designing, and made us much faster, but we ended up designing the same layouts we always have. It did made us faster, but not any more creative. Then, tailwind came along, and easy became the new standard. Now, we have AI, and it's even easier.

With this, we have finally created the holy trinity of boredom.

### Interesting layouts
One easy way to make more interesting layouts is to use different fraction units in a grid layout. Something like '2fr, 1fr, auto, 3fr' for example can already be a very interesting layout for an article.

When he thought of this, he felt like he was onto something, but he couldn't put his finger on it. Then he saw a talk from Kevin Powell which included a layout that had optional columns which only took up any space when there was space available, and would otherwise be hidden.

Can also apply this idea in a layout which is asymmetrical, by for example having one extra column on only one side.

Lining certain elements on the page on these different columns gives you a very interesting layout while still being consistent and responsive.

This idea can be done not only horizontally, but also vertically.

Using something like '4fr auto 5fr' on grid-template-rows can make it so that text in a block element goes slightly higher if it's small, which usually looks better than having it vertically centered.
### Takeaway

In the past, it's always felt like whenever he used fraction units, he would just use 1fr, but using different fr units is actually very viable, and can lead to great looking layouts.

Next time you open Figma, turn off the autopilot, just put the whitespace where you want it to be. Put it where it's unexpected. Break the rules, and try out new layouts.
