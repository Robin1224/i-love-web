## Tradeoffs in a project
- <u>Perfectionism</u>
	When should you consider something done? Where is the tradeoff between delivering in a timely fashion and delivering something you consider perfect? At some point you're bumping up against small edge cases and experimental features, which are no longer worth addressing. Sometimes you have to make the decision to finish a project and ship it rather than spending too much time fixing potential issues. Then you can address issues and edge cases once they are encountered by users.
	The tradeoff is that you deliver something that is potentially a little less good, but you save money on the amount of labour and hours spent developing it
- <u>Tech stack selection</u>
	Usually a tradeoff between where you have knowledge and can move quicker, and what works best for your project.
- <u>Design systems</u>
	You can use design systems to go way quicker, but your application will feel less personal and unique. This is a tradeoff. There is also an important distinction between UI and UX; you can build unique user experiences even if it looks exactly the same as other projects.
- <u>Performance vs maintainability</u>
	There is a tradeoff between making something perform well and making it easy to maintain. Oftentimes code that performs the best is also hard to read and understand. Certain conventions that make code readable will for example take more characters, or certain approaches in code are not as performant, but are easier to wrap your head around.
	Good example is Tailwind, where it might make you faster right now, but if you bring in a new engineer for example who doesn't know it, they will have to learn it first, which means that maintainability took a hit.
- <u>Velocity and Flexibility</u>
	Something might be extremely flexible and scaleable, but might be difficult to set up. While another product might be less flexible and scaleable, but much easier and faster to set up and use. This is also an important tradeoff.
- <u>Innovation and reliability</u>
	Any business has a product. It works on the idea that it is going to put in an amount of money, which will perform an operation, and a certain amount of money will come out as a result. The business will have a certain amount of products which is known as a portfolio. It can be easy to simply put more and more money into your product which is performing the best. However, to be sustainable long term, you have to put some money into R&D to research new products. This might be a money sink, but if it's successful, you will expand your portfolio which eventually makes you more profit in the long term. The tradeoff is between researching new products which could potentially produce much more income, or investing in your existing product which will more reliably produce a little less income. You have to find a balance, lest you either bankrupt yourself by sinking too much money through R&D or you don't innovate and get left behind.
- <u>Artificial Intelligence</u>
	AI is entirely a tradeoff. There are ethical implications, and there is a cost in terms of both environment and money. There is also an important tradeoff of accuracy: How accurate does it need to be for a specific task, and who assumes the risk when it gets it wrong? In a company right Directus for example, AI is not suitable in most situations, because everything you query and get back from the service should be 100% correct. You need to get the information you requested and data should be truth. You don't want to be responsible for one of your clients making a business decision based on false information your AI gave them.
